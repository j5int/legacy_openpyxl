Manipulating a workbook in memory
==================================
 
Create a workbook
-----------------

There is no need to create a file on the filesystem to get started with openpyxl.
Just import the Worbook class and start using it ::

	>>> from legacy_openpyxl[.]workbook import Workbook
	>>> wb = Workbook()
	
A workbook is always created with at least one worksheet. You can get it by 
using the :func:`legacy_openpyxl[.]workbook.Workbook.get_active_sheet` method ::

	>>> ws = wb.get_active_sheet()
	
.. note::

	This function uses the `_active_sheet_index` property, set to 0 by default.   
	Unless you modify its value, you will always get the
	first worksheet by using this method.

You can also create new worksheets by using the 
:func:`legacy_openpyxl[.]workbook.Workbook.create_sheet` method ::

	>>> ws1 = wb.create_sheet() # insert at the end (default)
	# or
	>>> ws2 = wb.create_sheet(0) # insert at first position
	
Sheets are given a name automatically when they are created. 
They are numbered in sequence (Sheet, Sheet1, Sheet2, ...).
You can change this name at any time with the `title` property::

	ws.title = "New Title"
	
Once you gave a worksheet a name, you can get it using 
the :func:`legacy_openpyxl[.]workbook.Workbook.get_sheet_by_name` method ::

	>>> ws3 = wb.get_sheet_by_name("New Title")
	>>> ws is ws3
	True
	
You can review the names of all worksheets of the workbook with the
:func:`legacy_openpyxl[.]workbook.Workbook.get_sheet_names` method ::

	>>> print wb.get_sheet_names()
	['Sheet2', 'New Title', 'Sheet1']
	

Playing with data
------------------

Accessing one cell
++++++++++++++++++

Now we know how to access a worksheet, we can start modifying cells content.

To access a cell, use the :func:`legacy_openpyxl[.]worksheet.Worksheet.cell` method::

	>>> c = ws.cell('A4')
	
You can also access a cell using row and column notation::

	>>> d = ws.cell(row = 4, column = 2)

.. note::

	When a worksheet is created in memory, it contains no `cells`. They are 
	created when first accessed. This way we don't create objects that would never
	be accessed, thus reducing the memory footprint.
	
.. warning::

	Because of this feature, scrolling through cells instead of accessing them
	directly will create them all in memory, even if you don't assign them a value.
	
	Something like ::
		
		>>> for i in xrange(0,100):
		...		for j in xrange(0,100):
		...			ws.cell(row = i, column = j)
					
	will create 100x100 cells in memory, for nothing.
	
	However, there is a way to clean all those unwanted cells, we'll see that later.
	
Accessing many cells
++++++++++++++++++++

If you want to access a `range`, wich is a two-dimension array of cells, you can use the 
:func:`legacy_openpyxl[.]worksheet.Worksheet.range` method::

	>>> ws.range('A1:C2')
	((<Cell Sheet1.A1>, <Cell Sheet1.B1>, <Cell Sheet1.C1>),
 	(<Cell Sheet1.A2>, <Cell Sheet1.B2>, <Cell Sheet1.C2>))
	  
	>>> for row in ws.range('A1:C2'):
	...		for cell in row:
	...			print cell
	<Cell Sheet1.A1>
	<Cell Sheet1.B1>
	<Cell Sheet1.C1>
	<Cell Sheet1.A2>
	<Cell Sheet1.B2>
	<Cell Sheet1.C2>
	
Data storage
++++++++++++
	
Once we have a :class:`legacy_openpyxl[.]cell.Cell`, we can assign it a value::

	>>> c.value = 'hello, world'
	>>> print c.value
	'hello, world'
	
	>>> d.value = 3.14
	>>> print d.value
	3.14
	
There is also a neat format detection feature that converts data on the fly::
	
	>>> c.value = '12%'
	>>> print c.value
	0.12
	 
	>>> import datetime
	>>> d.value = datetime.datetime.now()
	>>> print d.value
	datetime.datetime(2010, 9, 10, 22, 25, 18)
	
	>>> c.value = '31.50'
	>>> print c.value
	31.5
	
Saving to a file
================

To save a workbook, just import the :func:`legacy_openpyxl[.]writer.excel.save_workbook` function::

	>>> from legacy_openpyxl[.]writer.excel import save_workbook
	>>> save_workbook(wb, 'test.xlsx')
	True
	
.. note::

	Extension is not forced to be xlsx or xlsm, although you might have 
	some trouble opening it directly with another application if you don't
	use an official extension.
	
	As OOXML files are basically ZIP files, you can also end the filename 
	with .zip and open it with your favourite ZIP archive manager.
	
Loading from a file
=================== 
	
The same way as writing, you can import :func:`legacy_openpyxl[.]reader.excel.load_workbook` to 
open an existing workbook::

	>>> from legacy_openpyxl[.]reader.excel import load_workbook
	>>> wb2 = load_workbook('test.xlsx')
	>>> print wb2.get_sheet_names()
	['Sheet2', 'New Title', 'Sheet1']
